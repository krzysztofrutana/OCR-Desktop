The text translation window allows you to choose between the languages ​​available in the google translate service. The detect language option allows you to use google translator to determine the original language. Additionally, you can save the results in the form of two columns, in one the original text and the other translated. The length of the translated text is limited by google translator. It is possible to translate the selected text.
